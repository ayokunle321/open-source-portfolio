# Open Source Portfolio

This is a curated list of my open source contributions to projects particularly within the LLVM ecosystem. My work spans Clang/LLVM, MLIR, and ClangIR, involving everything from crash fixes and IR validation to codegen and lowering support.

## LLVM / MLIR

#### Clang

- **[clang][diagnostics] Refactor note_constexpr_invalid_cast to use enum_select**  
  Improved readability and maintainability of diagnostic logic.  
  _[PR #130868](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/130868)_

#### MLIR

- **[mlir][linalg] Add check for reduction operation in contraction body**  
  Prevented a crash in the `linalg-specialize-generic-ops` pass by verifying the presence of a valid reduction op.  
  _[PR #123134](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/123134)_

- **[mlir][affine] Add check for affine.for bound map results**  
  Added a check to catch affine loops with bound maps that have no results.  
  _[PR #127105](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/127105)_

- **[mlir][IR] Skip zero-result functions in test-func-erase-result pass**  
  Fixed an assertion error by ensuring functions with no results are skipped.  
  _[PR #127941](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/127941)_

- **[mlir][affine] Fix crash in affine-loop-fusion with empty op list**  
  Guarded against empty input to `getInnermostCommonLoop`.  
  _[PR #144841](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/144841)_

#### Documentation

- **[LangRef] Fix code segment and numbering in 'call' instruction**  
Fixed a formatting bug in the documentation of the `call` instruction.  
_Fixes [#122084](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/122084)_

## ClangIR

#### CodeGen and Builtin Support

- **Add support for `__builtin_elementwise_acos`**  
  Replaced `LLVMIntrinsicCallOp` with `ACosOp` in CIR.  
  _[PR #1507](https://github.com/llvm/clangir/pull/1507)_

- **Add support for `__builtin_elementwise_asin`**  
  Added `CIR_ASinOp` and full codegen support.  
  _[PR #1511](https://github.com/llvm/clangir/pull/1511)_

- **Add support for `__builtin_elementwise_atan`**  
  Added `CIR_ATanOp` and full codegen support.  
  _[PR #1512](https://github.com/llvm/clangir/pull/1512)_

#### ThroughMLIR Lowering

- **Lowering for ATanOp**  
  Implemented ThroughMLIR lowering for `ATanOp`.  
  _[PR #1528](https://github.com/llvm/clangir/pull/1528)_

- **Lowering for ACosOp**  
  Implemented ThroughMLIR lowering for `ACosOp`.  
  _[PR #1529](https://github.com/llvm/clangir/pull/1529)_

- **Lowering for ASinOp**  
  Implemented ThroughMLIR lowering for `ASinOp`.  
  _[PR #1530](https://github.com/llvm/clangir/pull/1530)_

#### X86 Builtins

- **Add support for X86 builtins: `tzcnt_u16`, `tzcnt_u32`, `tzcnt_u64`**  
  Implemented full codegen for these low-level intrinsics.  
  _[PR #1691](https://github.com/llvm/clangir/pull/1691)_
